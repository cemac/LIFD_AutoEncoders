TensorFlow is a very powerful library written in Python and C++ that facilitates the building and training of neural networks.\n",

    "    \n",
    "AutoEncoders are unsupervised learning technique that performs data encoding and decoding using feed forward neural networks made of two components:\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Encoder** translates input data into lower dimensional space. (lower dimensional encoding is referred to as the latent space representation) \n",
    "* **Decoder** tries to reconstruct the original data from the lower dimensional data\n",

    "    \n",
    "Auto-encoder is a complex mathematical model which trains on unlabeled as well as unclassified data and is used to map the input data to another compressed feature representation and from that feature representation reconstructing back the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics of Auto Encoders:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Data specific: Non-generic - so will only work on data similar to what it has been trained on, making it an inpractical technique for compression problems\n",
    "* Lossy: There will be a degradation of data\n",
    "* Avenue for learning useful representations without the need for labels   \n",
